    "- \"None of these methods will deliver the objective truth about which of a dataset’s observations are outliers, simply because there is no objective way of knowing whether something is truly an outlier or an honest-to-goodness data point your model should account for.\" - [Colin Gorrie](http://colingorrie.github.io/outlier-detection.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"In my view, the more formal statistical tests and calculations are overkill because they can’t definitively identify outliers. Ultimately, analysts must investigate unusual values and use their expertise to determine whether they are legitimate data points.\" - [Jim Frost](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/outliers/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"One important reason to look into outliers is to correct errors in your data. There are two things we should never do with outliers. The first is to silently leave an outlier in place and proceed as if nothing were unusual. The other is to drop an outlier from the analysis without comment just because it's unusual.\" - K. Barkdo"
